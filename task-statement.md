- **ID format:** `[underlying]_future_[expiry second]` (e.g. `$CARD_future_1400`)
- **Use case:** Direct exposure to delivery at a certain time in the future

## Interacting with the Platform

### Web Interface (Recommended to try first)
- **URL:** `192.168.100.10`
- **Features:** Real-time charts, order placement, portfolio tracking
- **Best for:** Getting to know the platform, gaining intuition and visual referencing
- **WARNING:** Each open tab of the web interface consumes one of your team's connections, so use it carefully

### WebSocket API
- **Endpoint:** `ws://[URL]:9001/trade?team_secret=YOUR_TEAM_SECRET`
- **Protocol:** JSON-based WebSocket messages
- **Best for:** Scored trading rounds

---

## Getting Your Credentials

Each team receives:
- **Team Name:** Your unique team identifier
- **Team ID:** Numeric identifier for your team
- **Team Secret:** Authentication key for API access

You will receive these physically at the competition, as well as the credentials to connect to the Wi-Fi.

---

## Collocation and delay server

- In trading, **collocation** means placing servers near an exchange to **reduce latency and execute trades faster**. It's used to gain a **speed advantage** in high-frequency trading.
- In our competition, collocation is simulated using Raspberry Pis. Each team has its own Raspberry Pi that you can connect to using SSH.
- Exact instructions and credentials for connecting to your Raspberry Pi will be printed out and given to you at the competition.
- Your direct connection to the server **has a certain delay**. During the rounds **some additional delay** will be added. On the other hand, **Raspberry Pis have 0 delay**.
- **Delay will impact** how fast your orders will be received and handled by the server.

---

## Test rounds

- Test rounds **do not** count towards final standings.
- Each test round lasts for 10 minutes (600 seconds).

---

## Scored rounds & Competition Format

- There will be **5 scored rounds**. These rounds **count towards your final standings**.
- Each scored round lasts for **30 minutes (1800 seconds)**.
- Each round has a **different coefficient** that determines its impact on your final score.
- Each round has a **different delay** that will impact your bots.
- Your score in each round is normalized based on **your relative performance** between the best and worst teams.
- Your **total score** is the sum of the scores from all rounds, calculated using the formula:

  

  Where:
  - **Sáµ¢** = your team's net worth in the i-th round
  - **S_min** = net worth of the lowest-ranked team in that round
  - **S_max** = net worth of the highest-ranked team in that round

| Round #No | Time        | Coefficient | Delay  |
| :-------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----- |
| 1         | 23:00-23:30 | 1000        | 0 ms   |
| 2         | 06:00-06:30 | 1500        | 100 ms |
| 3         | 09:00-09:30 | 2000        | 200 ms |
| 4         | 13:00-13:30 | 2500        | 350 ms |
| 5         | 16:00-16:30 | 3000        | 500 ms |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **401 Unauthorized:** Check your team secret
- **429 Rate Limited:** Reduce message frequency
- **Order Rejected:** Check balance and/or inventory
- **Connection Drops:** Implement reconnection logic

---

**Good luck, and may the best algorithm win!**

## Appendix: WebSocket API Quick Start

### 1. Connect to the Trading API

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://[URL]/trade?team_secret=YOUR_SECRET");

ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log("Connected to AlgoTrade 2025!");
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log("Received:", message);
};
```

### 2. Place Your First Order

```javascript
const order = {
  "type": "add_order",
  "user_request_id": "0000000000", // Same entry is returned in the reply
  "instrument_id": "$CARD_call_82630_360",
  "price": 10, // Price in cents, always an integer
  "expiry": 58233560, // Date.now() + 3600000, Expires in 1 hour, auto capped to option expiry
  "side": "bid", // "bid" to buy, "ask" to sell
  "quantity": 1 // Number of contracts
}

ws.send(JSON.stringify(order));

// Response sample:
{
  "type": "add_order_response",
  "user_request_id": "0000000000",
  "success": true,
  "data": { "order_id": 34 }
}
```

### 3. Monitor Your Portfolio

```javascript
// Request Inventory
const inventoryRequest = {
  type: "get_inventory",
  user_request_id: "my_req1",
};
ws.send(JSON.stringify(inventoryRequest));

// Request Pending Orders
const ordersRequest = {
  type: "get_pending_orders",
  user_request_id: "my_req2",
};
ws.send(JSON.stringify(ordersRequest));


// Example responses:
// Inventory Response
{
  "type": "get_inventory_response",
  "user_request_id": "my_req1",
  "data": { "$": [1760, 1000000] } // [positions, cash]
}

// Pending Orders Response
{
  "type": "get_pending_orders_response",
  "user_request_id": "my_req2",
  "data": {
    "$CARD_future_60": [
      [ // bids
        {
          "orderID": 25,
          "teamID": 1,
          "price": 1,
          "time": 5694,
          "expiry": 60000,
          "side": "BID",
          "unfilled_quantity": 1,
          "total_quantity": 1,
          "live": true
        }
      ],
      [] // asks
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Cancel Orders

```javascript
const cancelOrder = {
  type: "cancel_order",
  user_request_id: "my_cancel",
  order_id: 23,
  instrument_id: "$CARD_call_100676_75",
};

ws.send(JSON.stringify(cancelOrder));

// Response:
{
  "type": "cancel_order_response",
  "user_request_id": "my_cancel",
  "success": true
}
```

### Real-Time Market Data

The platform automatically streams:
- **Price Updates:** Real-time instrument prices
- **Order Book:** Live bid/ask depth
- **Trade Executions:** Your successful trades
- **Market Events:** Settlement notifications

```javascript
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  switch (data.type) {
    case "market_data_update":
      console.log(`${data.instrument_id}: $${data.price / 100}`);
      break;

    case "add_order_response":
      if (data.success) {
        console.log(`Order placed: ID ${data.data.order_id}`);
      } else {
        console.log(`Order failed: ${data.data.message}`);
      }
      break;

    case "trade_update":
      console.log(`Trade executed: ${data.quantity} @ $${data.price / 100}`);
      break;
    
    // Handle other message types...
  }
};
```
